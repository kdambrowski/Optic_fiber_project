## General Information
The project involves implementing Industry 4.0 concepts to automate the verification of produced fiber optic sensors, which is otherwise a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. The collected data includes three spectroscopic signals, and the goal is to use AI algorithms to predict the characteristics of a working sensor in water and isopropanol based on measured characteristics in air.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.7  
- Numpy - version 1.19.5  
- Pandas - version 1.3.0  
- Seaborn - version 0.11.1  
- Matplotlib - version 3.4.2  
- Scikit-learn - version 0.24.2  
- Scipy - version 1.7.0  

## Data Source
The data was obtained from the following sources:
- [ATA Scientific](https://www.atascientific.com.au/spectrometry/)
- [Coractive](https://www.coractive.com/applications/fiber-optic-sensors/)
- [i-Scoop](https://www.i-scoop.eu/industry-4-0/)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Building and evaluating machine learning models for predicting sensor characteristics in water and isopropanol based on measured characteristics in air
- Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance

## Screenshots
No screenshots available.

## Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages 
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Fiber_Optic_Sensors.ipynb`

## Usage
The notebook contains the code for preprocessing the data, building and evaluating machine learning models, and visualizing the results. You can use this code to predict the characteristics of a fiber optic sensor in water or isopropanol based on the spectroscopic signals measured in air.

## Project Status
The project is complete.

## Room for Improvement
- Use more advanced machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy
- Gather more data to increase the scope of the project
- Explore the use of other types of sensors in conjunction with fiber optic sensors
